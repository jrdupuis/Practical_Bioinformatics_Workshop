# Practical_Bioinformatics_Workshop

Bioinformatics & Genomics Workshop <br>
University of Iceland <br>
May 13 â€“ 16th 2024, Askja, Sturlugata 7, Reykjavik. <br>

This bootcamp-style practical bioinformatics workshop aims to teach essential bioinformatics skills widely used in population genomic projects. 

We do not assume prior experience, so we will start with basic computer literacy (Linux command line navigation, high-performance computing, Conda environments) before proceeding to SNP marker discovery from whole-genome sequencing (GATK pipeline), followed by analysis in R. 

Students will also be exposed to data management practices, troubleshooting, and common data formats (fastq, SAM, BAM, VCF). 

Our goal is to provide students with enough foundational knowledge and practical experience to independently explore and implement additional methods for their specific data needs.

At the end of the course students should be able to: 
* Use the command line to navigate directories & make and edit files.
* Use the command line to install software
* Use a high-performance computing cluster, including up/downloading files and submitting job scripts.
* Use the RStudio environment for genetic analyses
